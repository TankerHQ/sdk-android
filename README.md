[Overview](#overview) · [Getting started](#getting-started) · [Documentation](#documentation) · [Release notes](#release-notes) · [Contributing](#contributing) · [License](#license)

## Overview

Tanker is an open-source client SDK that can be embedded in any application.

It leverages powerful **client-side encryption** of any type of data, textual or binary, but without performance loss and assuring a **seamless end-user experience**. No cryptographic skills are required.

## Getting started

The Tanker SDK consists of the following package, which is distributed on https://maven.tanker.io:

- `io.tanker:tanker-bindings:X.Y.Z`

For setup instructions in an Android Studio project, please refer to the [Android implementation guide](https://docs.tanker.io/latest/api/core/android/).

Tanker also provides open-source **[iOS](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-ios)** and **[JavaScript](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-js)** SDKs.
